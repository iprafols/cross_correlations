----> flags:
----------------------------
*) Flag to compute the bootstrap realization: If this flag is set to 'true', the program
will compute num_bootstrap bootstrap samples of the cross-correlation (provided
flag_compute_cross_correlation is 'true') and the bootstrap covariance matrix (provided
flag_compute_covariance is 'true'). This option is disabled if flag_load_only is set to
'true'

flag_compute_bootstrap = true

*) Flag to compute the covariance matrix: If this flag is set to 'true', the program will
compute the covariance matrix. If flag_compute_bootstrap is also set to 'true', then the
program will also compute the bootstrap covariance matrix. This option is disabled if
flag_load_only is set to 'true'

flag_compute_covariance = true

*) Flag to compute the cross-correlation: If this flag is set to 'true', the program will
compute the cross-correlation of the specified datasets (see ---->  inputs). If
flag_compute_bootstrap is also set to 'true' then the program will generate num_bootstrap
bootstrap samples for the cross-correlation. This option is disabled if flag_load_only is
set to 'true'

flag_compute_cross_correlation = true

*) Flag to compute the distortion matrix: If this flag is set to 'true', the program will
compute the distortion matrix of the specified datasets (see ----> inputs). This option is
disabled if flag_load_only is set to 'true'

flag_compute_distortion = true

*) Flag to compute the plate neighbours list: If this flag is set to 'true', the program will
create a list of all the used plates and their neighbouring plates

flag_compute_plate_neighbours = false

*) Flag to compute the covariance matrix reading the pairs information from files: If this flag is
set to 'ture', the program will read the pairs information from the partial results files instead
of computing it directly. To use this flag, the code has to run with flag_compute_cross_correlation
set to 'true' and flag_write_results greater than 0 or has to have been run with this configuration
in the same output folder (see ----> output)

flag_covariance_matrix_from_file = false

*) Flag to end program after loading the datasets: If this flag is set to 'true', the program
will end after loading the required catalogs (and plotting their info if flag_plot_catalog_info
is set to 'true')

flag_load_only = false

*) Flag to plot: If this flag is set to 'true', the program will run the plotting scripts

flag_plot = true

*) Flag to plot the catalog information: If set to 'true', then the program will create the
scripts necessary to plot the right ascention-declination dispersion and the redshift histogram
for the diferent datasets

flag_plot_catalog_info = false

*) Verbose flag: The higher the value for this flag, the more information the program will
display on screen. Incrementing the value for this flag will
result in an equal increment on the different specific verbose flags. To avoid this specifically
add the desired values for the other verbose flags

flag_verbose = 1

*) C IV spectra verbose flag: Verbose flag for the class CIVSpectraDataset

flag_verbose_civ_spectra_dataset = 1

*) Pair dataset verbose flag: Verbose flag for the class PairDataset

*) Plate neighbours verbose flag: Verbose flag for the class PlateNeighbours

flag_verbose_plate_neighbours = 1

*) Quasar dataset verbose flag: Verbose flag for the class QuasarDataset

flag_verbose_quasar_dataset = 1

*) Write partial results: When this flag is greater than zero, then the program will
save partial results information in the results directory (see ----> outputs).
The amount of information saved depends on the value of the flag. Note that the code will
become much more slower for values greater than zero.

flag_write_partial_results = 0

*) Number of plates to ignore at the beginning of the computation. This is thought to be used in
conjunction with flag_write_results > 0 to resum an interrupted computation. If the number is
greater than zero, then the program will not overwrite the partial results files
(see ----> outputs) but will append to it. Note that the resulting cross-correlation measurement
will not include the specified number of plates. Once the computation is complete, then the
program should be rerun with flag_write_results = 0
